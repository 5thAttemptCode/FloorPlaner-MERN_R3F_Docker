PROJECT: Floor Planner

LIVE DEMO: https://floor-planer.netlify.app/

TECHSTACK: MERN, React-Three-Fiber, Vite, Docker, Blender.

HOSTING PLATFORM: Render.com for backend | Netlify.com for frontend  


ABOUT:
This is my first MERN Stack application. It is inspired by an event during my time working as a roofer, that made me really understand the term "problem solving" with software.
In this application a user can choose between different floor materials for their home renovation project. To give the user the most realistic result of the floor material, the floor material can be added to a 3D room model and the wall color can be adjusted to their liking. Also there is lightswitch-button to show the user how the floor material will look in daylight and with dimmed lights during the evening. 

The development environment of this project is build with Vite. I prefer Vite over fx Webpack or CRA, since it offers a faster and more seamless workflow.

The backend of this application concist of Node, Express and MongoDB. A user can sign-up/ sign-in to their user account to place an order. Also this application is dockerized to keep things consistent across different setups.

The frontend is build with React, while the 3D configurator is build using React Three Fiber. The simple 3D model is build in Blender. For statemanagement I use Valtio. 
The UI is inspired by the web design trend "bento box", which is quite modern and goes well with the subject "home renovation". For an improved UX React Toastify was utilized.   


CONCLUSION: This project was out of my comfort zone by any means, which I really enjoyed. I had a vision of this project in my mind, which helped me understanding my way through the, at times daunting, world of Backend. Once you understand the concept of each backend-file it makes the process of building and debugging much more smooth. Using MongoDB Compass is a great way to avoid the sometimes very confusing UI of their website, and work more focused. Docker seemed a little "to easy" to implement at first, however the installing process of the this program makes you realize that it isnt. Initially, Docker may appear straightforward to implement, yet the installation process of this software underscores its complexity and challenges.
