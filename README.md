Project: Floor Planner

This is my first MERN Stack application. It is inspired by an event during my time working as a roofer, that made me really understand the term "problem solving" with software.
In this application a user can choose between different floor materials for their home renovation project. To give the user the most realistic result of the floor material, the floor material can be added 
to a 3D model of a room and the wall color can be adjusted to their liking. Also there is lightswitch-button to show the user how the floor material will look in daylight and with dimmed lights during the evening. 
What I'm working on at the moment, 20.01.2024, is dockerizing this application - so I'm learning Docker.

The backend of this application concist of Node, Express and MongoDB. A user can sign up/ sign in to their user account to place an order. 

The frontend is build with React, while the 3D configurator is build using React Three Fiber. The simple 3D model is build in Blender. For statemanagement I use Valtio. 
The UI is inspired by the web design trend "bento box", which is quite modern and goes well with the subject "home renovation".
